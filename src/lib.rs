//! A simple 2D grid library, including a generic heap-allocated 2D grid struct and a 2D vector struct.
//!
//! For a position `Vector { x, y }` in the grid:
//! * `x` determines which column the position is in
//! * `y` determines which row the position is in
//!
//! There are `width` columns and `height` rows in the grid, and the grid's iterators traverse it in row-major order.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use grid::{Grid, vct};
//!
//! let mut grid: Grid<u8> = Grid::new(8, 10, 0);
//!
//! grid[vct!(1, 0)] = 1;
//! grid[vct!(3, 5)] = 2;
//!
//! assert_eq!(grid[vct!(3, 5)], 2);
//! assert_eq!(grid[vct!(1, 0)], 1);
//! assert_eq!(grid[vct!(6, 4)], 0);
//!
//! println!("{:?}", grid);
//! ```
//!
//! ```
//! use grid::Vector;
//!
//! let mut v = Vector::new(1, 2);
//!
//! while v.x < 5 {
//!     v += Vector::new(1, 3);
//! }
//!
//! v *= 2;
//!
//! assert_eq!(v, Vector::new(10, 28));
//! ```
